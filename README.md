# Generate Social Media Images With Cloudinary

This site creates social media sharing cards for the [Netlify blog](https://www.netlify.com/blog/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=netlify-social-images-jl&utm_campaign=devex). It’s powered by [Cloudinary](https://jason.af/cloudinary) and [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=netlify-social-images-jl&utm_campaign=devex).

The images look something like this:

![Add the title of the article you’re sharing! Wow! It’s so easy!](https://res.cloudinary.com/jlengstorf/image/upload/w_1300/g_west,c_fit,co_rgb:FFFFFFFF,w_1200,x_50,y_25,l_text:dillan.otf_110_line_spacing_-22:Add%20the%20title%20of%20the%20article%20you%E2%80%99re%20sharing!%20Wow!%20It%E2%80%99s%20so%20easy!/v1591839476/netlify/og.png)
